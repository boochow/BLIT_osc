# BLIT sawtooth oscillator

A sawtooth oscillator for KORG logue-SDK-compatible synthesizers

Thanks to the BLIT technique, this oscillator sounds better than wavetable-based sawtooth oscillators in general.

The Binaries are [here](https://github.com/boochow/BLIT_osc/releases).

Parameters:

- Leaky: leak parameter for the leaky integrator.
- Lowpass:  maximum frequency of upper harmonics.
